# RH2019Project
Our project for Royal Hackaway 2019 involves a Python program that takes an image from a specified filepath and converts the image into ASCII characters using different characters to determine the grayscale of each section of the inage.

this project took inspiration from the book "Python Playground: Geeky Projects for the Curious Programmer by Mahesh Venkitachalam.".
Our codebase was sourced from this book and from the book's github page: "https://github.com/electronut/pp/blob/master/ascii/ascii.py"
